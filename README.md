# hono-adapter-aws-lambda [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/hono-adapter-aws-lambda?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hono-adapter-aws-lambda)

**hono-adapter-aws-lambda** is my starter/boilerplate for typescript projects.  
This template assumes you are using Linux, or the included Dev Container.

### Notes (remove this section when you use the template)
#### * Do a global replace for `hono-adapter-aws-lambda` and `NamesMT`

#### * I'm heavily inspired by [antfu](https://github.com/antfu) and [UnJS](https://github.com/unjs), some notable things:
- [antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni)
- [antfu/taze](https://github.com/antfu/taze)
- [antfu/vscode-settings](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-settings)
- [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config)
  - Style error silencing is commented out

#### * Script: `play` vs `play:useBuild` for playground testing?
- `play` script uses `unbuild`'s [passive watcher (stub mode)](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild#-passive-watcher), which allows you to execute new code **live** without rebuilding the project. The cons is TS declarations are not available.
- `play:useBuild` builds a static version of the package, useful for testing the actual look/behavior when shipping.
